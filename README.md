# Reading Seals Tracker (Destiny-inspired)

This is a small React site that lets you track **Reading Seals** (themes) with **Triumphs**, earn titles, and **gild** them each year.

## Run it locally

1) Install Node.js (LTS)
2) Unzip this folder
3) In the project folder, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL Vite prints (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Build for hosting

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production build is created in `dist/`.

## Notes
- All data is stored locally in your browser via `localStorage`.
- The seal emblems are **procedural SVG** and **original** (no Destiny assets).

Enjoy the chase. 📚🏅
